Perform the following steps to check out and test the FastQC workflow code.  Start from a working directory $ROOT.  These steps assume you are using tcsh shell.  If using another shell, adjust the script config/fastqc_init.tcsh accordingly.

Installation and run-time configuration steup:

cd $ROOT
svn export  https://pfizer.collab.net/svn/repos/fastqc/trunk/perl
cd perl
source config/fastqc_init.tcsh

Then run the following scripts to confirm functionality and get started:

The following should report a summary of system configuration variables:
perl -c scripts/show_config.pl

Simple unit tests are in the t/ subdirectory, and must be run from the main 'perl'
directory.  For example:

perl -c t/140_test_parseSampleSheet.t

The main code modules are found in lib/Pfizer/FastQC.
